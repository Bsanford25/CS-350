# CS-350 Thermostat Project

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to create a thermostat using the SImpleLink CC3220S development board. It allowed the user to set the desired temperature and simulated the heat turning on and communicating that information to the server using UART.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel as though i did well with implementing the task scheduler.

Where could you improve?
I am sure I could improve a lot, the code could probably be simpler and i could use more in-line comments. I could also improve on state machines.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I have added a lot of experience using CCS and working with embedded systems as well. I had never done any work with an MCU prior to taking this course.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I learned a lot more about coding in C and C++, also my understanding of embedded systems is much stronger than it was befoe. I am starting to see how I can write code to make peripherals work together and having those work with the temperature sensor.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to use as many comments as i could without making it look messy.
